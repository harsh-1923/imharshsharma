        Hi, I am a Software Engineer based in Bengaluru, India, with a little
        over a year of experience in developing large-scale software
        applications and user experiences.
        <br />
        <br />I am a big fan of delightful user experience. I often find myself
        obsessed with typography, motion design, borders, shadows, and the list
        goes on and on. Currently, I am experimenting with some of them at
        ScribleUI.
